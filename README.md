# Hello there! I'm Martim ü§†

A **Data Scientist** with a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. I love gathering different types of data that, at first glance, might make no sense. But with the right tools and approach, I uncover powerful insights, develop new methodologies, and improve existing ones to reach their maximum potential.  

With expertise in **Python, R, SQL**, and **Machine Learning**, I thrive at the intersection of analytical rigor and business impact. 

I am currently looking for new challenges that use data science to drive smarter decision making. I enjoy collaborating across teams, building scalable solutions and diving into hard data problems to uncover patterns that matter.  

Feel free to explore my repositories for projects on **machine learning, process optimization**, and beyond. Let's connect and create something amazing together! üöÄ
